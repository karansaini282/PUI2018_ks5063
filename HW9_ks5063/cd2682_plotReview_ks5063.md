![Plot of cd2682](myplot_cd2682.png)

## Comments

* CLARITY: The quantities being visualized are clear (since normalization has been done) and plot is easy to read.

* ESTHETIC: Graphical elements (bar plots) are justified and allow us to focus on comparison of distribution. 

* HONESTY: The plot honestly reproduces the data.

## Suggestions

* Shorter trips and longer trips have been chosen as values below and above the mean value respectively. A different scheme such as quantiles (maybe 0%-25% and 75%-100%) might be worth considering to analyze extremes and get rid of near median values.
