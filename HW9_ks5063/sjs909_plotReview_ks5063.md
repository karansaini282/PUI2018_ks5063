# Review of sjs909 Homework 8 plot by ks5063

![Plot 1 of sjs909](Demographics.png)

## Comments

* Color pallete has been tested for color blindness.
* There is no redundant information shown.
* Plot includes legend, labels and title.

## Suggestions

* Color scheme for "Hispanic and Latino" is very similar to background. Changing the color or adding edge-color might help differentiate it from the background.
* Stack plot is relatively difficult for the human eye to analyze. Instead of showing multiple counties, a single bar plot with mean diversity breakdown (race on the x-axis) for counties with high female population might show information better.
