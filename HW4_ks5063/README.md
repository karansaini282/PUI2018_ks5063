* Assignment 1 + Extra Credit : Done by Karan (ks5063)
    * First step was changing dictionary keys from distribution size to indices to prevent overwriting of keys.
    * Normal distribution was assigned mean = 100 using loc = 100. Sample mean vs Sample size was observed.
    * Poisson distribution was assigned mean = 100 using lam = 100. Sample mean vs Sample size was observed.
    * Binomial distribution was assigned mean = 100 using n = 200 and p = 0.5. Sample mean vs Sample size was observed.
    * Lognormal distribution was assigned mean = 100 using mean = np.log(100) - 0.5. Sample mean vs Sample size was observed.
    * All distributions were combined.
        * Sample mean vs Sample size was observed.
        * Gaussian curve was fitted to the histogram.
